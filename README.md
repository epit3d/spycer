## Basic usage

Right now you can use Spycer in "preview" mode.
It means that you can locally setup Spycer and see our possibilities without having slicer and 5 axes 3D printer.
Slicer software we develop is not open source yet, but you can ask us for demo.

For legacy use you can try latest open source version of slicer: [goosli](https://github.com/epit3d/goosli).
We do not have capabilities to support integration with current Spycer version, but you may try old Spycer version from about Oct 24, 2020.

## Installation

1. Install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
